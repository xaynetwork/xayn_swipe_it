### Create a new issue :raising_hand_man: :raising_hand_woman:

The easiest way to get involved is to create a [new issue](https://github.com/xaynetwork/flutter-open-source-repo-template/issues/new) when you 
  - spot a bug
  - documentation is incomplete or out of date
  - you identify an implementation problem.

----------

### General coding guidlines :nail_care:

If you'd like to add a feature or fix a bug, we're more than happy to accept pull requests! We only ask a few things:

  - Write helpful documentation
  - Write tests for all new code paths
  - Ensure your code contains no analyzer errors, e.g.
    - Code is strong-mode compliant
    - Code is free of lint errors
    - run `flutter analyze lib test`
  - Format your code with `flutter format lib --set-exit-if-changed && flutter format test --set-exit-if-changed`
